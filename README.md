# _{Ping-Pong}_

#### _{Enter a number and the program will play ping-pong with the numbers}_

#### By _**{Keir Staple}**_

## Description

_{This is a program that allows you to enter a number and then the page will display every number from 1 to the entered number in an unordered list. Multiples of 3 will be replaced with 'ping', multiples of 5 will be replaced with 'pong', and multiples of both 3 and 5 will be replaced with 'pingpong'. There is a left sidebar indicating the level 2 course I would like to take.}_

## Known Bugs

_Since the submit function appends the unordered list to the DOM, it is difficult to resubmit the form without refreshing the page to get new form results. You can resubmit new information but it will append after the previous list._
